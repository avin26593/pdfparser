		Consolidated Account Statement	
Summary	Holdings	Transactions   Your Account   About NSDL	
Dear Investor,			
Greetings from NSDL.			
We are pleased to bring you NSDL Consolidated Account Statement (NSDL CAS). NSDL CAS is a single statement of all your			
investments in the securities market. All your investments in equity shares, preference shares, mutual funds, bonds, debentures,			
securitised instruments, government securities (other than held in SGL), commercial paper and certificates of deposit are included in			
this Consolidated Account Statement. It includes all investments held in single or joint names with you as the sole/first holder.			
NSDL CAS is part of the overall vision to enable all financial assets to be held electronically in a single demat account, which was			
articulated by the Hon'ble Finance Minister in his budget speech of July 2014. As a step in this direction, SEBI has introduced this			
Consolidated Account Statement for all securities assets by consolidating demat accounts and mutual fund folios.			
As a part of our endeavor to enhance investor experience, we have introduced the feature of viewing details of all your insurance			
policies held by you in your e-Insurance Account (eIA) with NSDL National Insurance Repository (NIR). In case you do not have eIA,			
please visit https://www.nir.ndml.in/ to open eIA online. We are now introducing additional feature of  Portfolio Value Trend whereby			
you will be able to view historical monthly movement of your consolidated portfolio value over time. We have also introduced two new			
fields viz., "Date of Birth" and "Aadhaar Number" under the section of "Know more about your accounts" in respect of your NSDL			
demat account(s). Additionally, a new feature of "Annualised Return" has been incorporated in NSDL CAS to provide information			
pertaining to return on your investments in respect of mutual funds schemes held in MF Folios.			
I am sure that you will find NSDL CAS very useful. It offers you unparalleled convenience in keeping track of your investment			
portfolio. You can easily monitor the investments you hold, their value and portfolio composition. It will help you in developing strategy			
to manage your investments better. Further, we intend to bring you more features and services in the future. Please visit			
https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com for more information. We welcome your feedback and suggestions on this initiative of NSDL.			
Yours Sincerely,			
G. V. Nageswara Rao			
Managing Director & CEO

		Portfolio Value Trend	
Monthly movement of your Consolidated Portfolio Value since September 2018 is given below.It reflects the monthly change in your total wealth invested in the assets			
which are consolidated in NSDL CAS. Increase in your portfolio value may be due to appreciation of your investments and also fresh investments. Similarly, decrease in			
portfolio value may be due to depreciation in investments or sale of investments.
